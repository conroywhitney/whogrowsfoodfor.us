# USDA Innovation Challenge
@conroywhitney's entry to the USDA Innovation Challenge 2015 ([usdaapps.devpost.com](https://usdaapps.devpost.com))

## Goals
The aim of this project is to show not only where various agricultural
products are produced around the country (both crop- and animal-based),
but also to give a window into the land, communities, and methods that are involved in the
production of our food here in the United States.

To that end, this project has two key pieces of functionality:
 * To allow users to view which regions around the country are involved in the production
   of specific agricultural products, and to what degrees.
 * To allow users to view metadata about production areas of a given agricultural product, such as temperatures, precipitation, and
   socioeconomics; as well as to look into projected values relating to climate change.

The goal is to allow farmers, researches, and consumers to gain a better
understanding of our food system, both where it is now, and what it might look like in the future.

## Data
The data used for this project can be downloaded in its original format.
Additionally, you can view the code used to transform from the public
format into the datasets in the `data` folder which is used by the
visualizations.
